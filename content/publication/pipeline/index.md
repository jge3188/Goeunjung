abstract: Research on health outcomes of environmental factors has been implemented by multiple and interacting factors, including environmental, socio-demographic, economic, and traffic aspects. There are still significant challenges and limitations in constructing databases for the connections between contributing factors and an integrated approach to environmental health research even though there has been a dramatic increase in data availability and incredible technological advance in data storage and processing. This study emphasizes the necessity of establishing a geospatial data pipeline to analyze the impact of environmental factors on health. It also highlights the difficulties and solutions related to the construction and utilization of a geospatial database. Key challenges include diverse data sources and formats, different spatio-temporal data structures, and coordinate system inconsistencies over time within the same geospatial data. To address these issues, a data pipeline was constructed with pre-processing and post-processing for the data, resulting in refined datasets that could be used for calculating geographic variables. In addition, an AWS-based relational database and shared platform were established to provide an efficient environment for data storage and analysis. Guidelines for each step of the process, including data management and analysis, were developed to enable future researchers to effectively use the data pipeline.
