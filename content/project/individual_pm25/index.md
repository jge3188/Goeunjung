## Summary
This project aims to develop a methodology for assessing and predicting individual exposure to particulate matter (PM2.5) across outdoor, indoor, and personal environments to evaluate the health impacts of PM2.5 on elderly populations within cohorts (KoGES, KFACS). Individual PM2.5 exposure is categorized into outdoor, indoor, and personal exposure, each with distinct sources and spatiotemporal characteristics.
Correlations between outdoor, indoor, and personal PM2.5 exposure have been reported as relatively low, indicating the need for independent approaches. Notably, PM2.5 components that reflect pollution sources are influenced by localized conditions, requiring methodologies that account for the spatiotemporal variability of PM2.5 exposure on a personal level. In this project, sampling was conducted for approximately 60 elderly cohort participants across various households. PM2.5 concentrations were measured in outdoor, indoor, and personal environments, covering all four seasons. PM2.5 measurements were taken using RTIâ€™s MicroPEM device, with gravimetric corrections applied to adjust concentration measurements.
To assess personal PM2.5 exposure, participants carried a bag containing the MicroPEM device for about five days each season. During this period, they also recorded hourly activity information, locations visited, and public transportation usage. Additionally, a GPS device was attached to the MicroPEM, enabling the collection of participants' movement data over the five-day period.
