## Summary
This project analyzed accessibility to essential Social Overhead Capital (SOC) facilities for citizens by examining travel times using a road network-based approach. SOC refers to fundamental infrastructure and public services required for daily life, including education, healthcare, and parks. Assessing the minimum travel time to reach these SOC facilities is crucial for addressing infrastructure disparities, enhancing convenience, and promoting social equity and integration.
Focusing on South Chungcheong Province in South Korea, this study evaluated the population and area that could reach each SOC facility within the designated minimum travel time (threshold time). Network analysis was conducted using an OD Cost Matrix, and travel times to each SOC facility were measured from centroids of population 500*500 grid, based on a high-resolution road network.
